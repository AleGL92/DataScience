In this folder there are some codes for applying deep learning to natural language processing.

The first code is NLP_Ale, where there's an example of how the tokenization and the padding works

In the second code (NLP_RVWS), there's a prediction of the sentimient for Yelp and Amazon reviews. The data comes from Kaggle again, and the data is uploaded to this repository, 
so the code works just downloading it and running it locally. Before tokeninzing, the text has to be prepared, then the model is created using a neuronal network with embeddings and, finally, there are some predictions.

The third code in the folder (NLP_RVWS_2) is the continuation to the previous one. To try to get better results, the tokenization is done using subwords, the model is defined using average pooling instead of a flatten layer, 
and a bidirectional long-short term memory layer is added aswell.

Finally, in the fourth code (NLP_GEN), there's an example of how to create text, using the same kind of predictions I used before.
