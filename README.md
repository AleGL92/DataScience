# TensorFlow

In this repository you can find some of my TensorFlow proyects. 

Currently, there are 4 proyects:
  - TF_OHM: Predicts results for Ohm's law, which is a regression exercise for a linear equation.
  - TF_RPS_2: Image classification using a neural network for one of Tensoflow's public datasets. The images are hands playing rock, paper or scissors.
              It also predicts some images of hands that I took with my cellphone.
              To resize and crop those images, the code res.py is used. The resulting images were uploaded to the HandPics folder.
              In this code, I have commented what many of the lines do.
  - TF_HoH: Classification of the Human or Horse dataset. This code is very similar to the last one, but there are no comments.
  - NLP: Inside the folder there are 4 codes for natural language processing. They show how to predict the sentiment of some reviews, tokenizing the text and using an enmbedding            layer in the model. Another of the codes, shows how to create some lyrics, based on the lyrics used to train the model.
