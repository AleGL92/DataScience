# TensorFlow

In this repository you can find some of my TensorFlow proyects. 

Currently, there are 3 proyects:
  - TF_OHM: Predicts results for Ohm's law, which is a regression exercise for a linear equation.
  - TF_RPS_2: Image classification for one of Tensoflow's public datasets. The images are hands playing rock, paper or scissors.
              It also predicts some images of hands that I took with my cellphone.
              To resize and crop those images, the code res.py is used. The resulting images were uploaded to the HandPics folder.
              In this code, I have commented what many of the lines do.
  - TF_HoH: Classification of the Human or Horse dataset. This code is very similar to the last one, but there are no comments.
